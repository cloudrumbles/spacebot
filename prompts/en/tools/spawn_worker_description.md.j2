Spawn an independent worker process. By default this starts a builtin worker with {tools} tools. The worker only sees the task description you provide — no conversation history.{opencode_note}

Field rules:
- `task` is required and must be specific.
- `interactive` is optional (default: `false`).
- `skill` is optional, but only for builtin workers.
- `task_type` is optional (`coding`, `summarization`, `deep_reasoning`).
- `worker_type` is optional (default: `builtin`).
- If `worker_type` is `opencode`, `directory` is required.

Examples:
- Builtin one-shot:
  `{"task":"Run cargo test --lib and summarize failures"}`
- Builtin interactive with routing hint:
  `{"task":"Investigate flaky tests in messaging module","interactive":true,"task_type":"coding"}`
- OpenCode worker:
  `{"task":"Refactor cron tool validation and update tests","worker_type":"opencode","directory":"/home/shah/workspace/spacebot","interactive":true,"task_type":"coding"}`
