Execute a custom tool by name. Pass the tool name (as returned by tool_search) and a JSON object of arguments matching the tool's parameter schema. The tool runs as a subprocess — arguments are piped as JSON to stdin, and the result is captured from stdout. Returns success status, output, and any stderr. To create new tools, write a tool.json manifest and a run.py (or run.sh) script into the tools directory.
