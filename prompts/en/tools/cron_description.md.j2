Manage scheduled tasks (cron jobs). Use this to create, list, or delete cron jobs. A cron job runs a prompt on a schedule and delivers the result to a messaging channel.

Action requirements:
- `action: "create"` requires: `id`, `prompt`, `schedule`
- `action: "list"` requires: `action` only
- `action: "delete"` requires: `action` plus either `delete_id` or `id`

Create actions default delivery to the current conversation channel.

Schedule supports either:
- standard cron expression syntax (5 fields): minute hour day-of-month month day-of-week
- one-shot absolute timestamp: `@once:<RFC3339>` (for example `@once:2026-02-20T14:30:00Z`)

Examples:
- "0 9 * * *" = every day at 9:00 AM
- "*/5 * * * *" = every 5 minutes
- "0 9 * * 1-5" = weekdays at 9:00 AM
- "30 14 1 * *" = 1st of every month at 2:30 PM
- "0 0 * * 0" = every Sunday at midnight
- "@once:2026-02-20T14:30:00Z" = run once at that exact timestamp

Example payloads:
- Create:
  `{"action":"create","id":"timer_2min","prompt":"Send a reminder message","schedule":"@once:2026-02-20T14:30:00Z"}`
- List:
  `{"action":"list"}`
- Delete:
  `{"action":"delete","delete_id":"timer_2min"}`
