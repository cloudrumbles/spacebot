Manage scheduled tasks (cron jobs). Use this to create, list, or delete cron jobs. A cron job runs a prompt on a schedule and delivers the result to a messaging channel.

Schedule uses standard cron expression syntax (5 fields): minute hour day-of-month month day-of-week.

Examples:
- "0 9 * * *" = every day at 9:00 AM
- "*/5 * * * *" = every 5 minutes
- "0 9 * * 1-5" = weekdays at 9:00 AM
- "30 14 1 * *" = 1st of every month at 2:30 PM
- "0 0 * * 0" = every Sunday at midnight
