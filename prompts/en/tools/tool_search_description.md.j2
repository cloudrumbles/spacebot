Search for available custom tools. Custom tools are script-based tools that can be created at runtime without recompiling. Use an empty query to list all available tools, or provide a search term to filter by name and description. Each result includes the tool's name, description, parameter schema, and usage examples. Use tool_execute to run a discovered tool.
